# Student Score Prediction with Supervised ML

Welcome to the Graduate Rotational Internship Program at The Sparks Foundation! In Task 01 of Data Science and Business Analytics, we focus on predicting the percentage score of a student based on the number of hours studied. This task involves a straightforward application of supervised machine learning, specifically utilizing a simple linear regression model with two variables: hours studied and percentage score.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates a student's percentage score based on the number of hours devoted to studying. By leveraging supervised ML techniques, we aim to create a reliable tool that educators and students can use to forecast academic performance.

## Dataset

The dataset provided contains information on the number of hours each student studied and their corresponding percentage scores. This data serves as the foundation for training and evaluating our predictive model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Utilized for an interactive and iterative development environment.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Employed for implementing the machine learning model and evaluating its performance.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Used for data visualization to gain insights into the dataset.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset, inspect its structure, and explore the relationships between variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle any missing values or outliers.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the dataset to identify patterns and insights that may aid model development.
4. **Model Development**: Implement a simple linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
5. **Training the Model**: Train the model on the provided dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
7. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict percentage scores based on new input data.

## How to Run

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`student_score_prediction.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.
